# CT-applied-machine-learning
My work for Cornell Tech's CS 5785: Applied Machine Learning homeworks. So far seems to contain three different learning approaches.
* **Library and framework literacy**: Using PyTorch, numpy, and more to do specific or applied calculations.
* **Practical ML**: Applying skills to an open-ended Kaggle competition, including preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering.
* **ML Written Exercises**: Understanding ML foundations and assumptions and how that applies to model interpretability and performance.

## NLP Binary Classification of Disaster Twitter Tweets
* Used logistic regression and natural-language-processing to classify tweets as disaster or non-disaster.
* Experimented with hyperparameter optimization and regularization methods to improve model generalizability by 15%.
